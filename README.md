# DungeonCrawl
Currently can be used to display a layout through System.out by running main in DungeonTest. Project was set up to use a display and take input, but has since been depreciated and is not being worked on, so it just displays a single floor layout now.
Key: 
# = wall
  = floor
| = corridor (floor)
4 = door

note: in System.out, all tiles are printed twice to horizontally stretch the image.
